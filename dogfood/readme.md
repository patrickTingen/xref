# Dogfood?

Yes. Since one should eat its own dogfood, I created a program to generate the XREF information for the XREF tool itself. Use this program as a starting point for your own application.

This program assumes you installed the XREF db in c:\Data\Progress\xref

The program has lots of comments to show what to change where.
